#### Dataset 
`data.js` file containing information about the the eye-witness reports on alien sightings in the form of an array of JavaScript objects.

The comments column in the dataset contained some HTML coded characters. These were replaced by corresponding punctuation marks in the JavaScript code
prior to displaying any results on the webpage.

## UFO Level 1
A webpage was designed to display all the alien sightings in the form of a table.
User can enter a spectific date to filter the results for a given date. 

Java Script code listens for an event on the 'Filter Table' button and filters the data according to the user input.
If no date is entered by the user, all the alien sightings in the dataset are displayed on the website.

## UFO Level 2
This page provides the user with an option to filter resuts based on multiple inputs in the form of dropdown menus for date, city, state, country, and shape.
The webpage also provides the functionality to deselect a filter if needed. 

Java Script code listens for an change in values of any of the dropdown menu fields and filters the data accordingly. For each change,
the number of results found are also displayed along with the filtered results/ rows in the HTML table.

All the filters can be reset to the default (no selection) option using the 'Reset Filters' button.
